# Responsive For Teams

**What it is:**  
A collection of Compass/SASS frameworks

**It's intention:**  
To use one Compass configuration file to process multiple responsive frameworks. By keeping the various frameworks in separate directories, you can easily start running with your framework of choice.

**Compiling:**  
I use [CodeKit](https://incident57.com/codekit/) to compile, concatenate, and minify all the coffeescript, javascript, and scss/less/css files. It reckognizes the compass config file and is IDE agnostic since it just monitors changes in files. Plus it allows you to combine (append/prepend) files.

**Licences:**  
All licences belong to their respective authors:
* [Gumby](https://github.com/GumbyFramework/Gumby/blob/master/README.md)

All I did was pool it together. Use it at your own risk.
