# Responsive For Teams

**What it is:**  
A collection of Compass/SASS frameworks

**It's intention:**  
This directory structure allows has one compass configuration file that references a sass directory within the src directory. By keeping the various frameworks (and versions of frameworks) in separate directories, you can easily start running with your framework of choice.

**Compiling:**  
I use [CodeKit](https://incident57.com/codekit/) to compile, concatenate, and minify all the coffeescript, javascript, and scss/less/css files. It reckognizes the compass config file and is IDE agnostic since it just monitors changes in files. Plus it allows you to combine (append/prepend) files.
